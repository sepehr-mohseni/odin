# Odin API Gateway Roadmap

This document outlines the planned future development for the Odin API Gateway project.

## Long-term Goals (6-12 months)

- [ ] Ability to add Go plugin and register as middleware from admin panel similar to Traefik api gateway plugin registration
- [ ] Integration with popular API management platforms like Postman API Platform and Amazon API Gateway
- [ ] Refactor to a better structured html templates with good coding
- [ ] Add all the abilities to frontend admin panel to manage all o the gateway setting and monitoring from the admin panel (based on already implemented goals and features and help of files in docs folder and other document readme and roadmap and files and codes)
- [ ] Upgrade to latest Go version and packages
